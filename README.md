# Twitter Sentiment Classification: NLP-based Model

## Introduction
Twitter is a widely-used social media platform where users express their thoughts, opinions, and emotions through tweets. However, the platform faces a significant issue with the misuse of its space for spreading harmful or hateful content. To combat this challenge, this project aims to develop an effective Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based classifier that can detect and filter negative sentiments, preventing their widespread dissemination.

The dataset used consists of tweet text paired with sentiment labels. Each entry in the training set includes a specific word or phrase (referred to as `selected_text`) that is extracted from the tweet, representing the sentiment conveyed. The objective of the model is to predict the word or phrase within the tweet that best captures the sentiment, accounting for all characters in that span (including punctuation, spaces, and special characters).

## Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **textID**: A unique identifier for each tweet.
- **text**: The full content of the tweet.
- **sentiment**: The overall sentiment of the tweet (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:

1. **Understand and clean the dataset** (if necessary).
2. **Develop and train classification models** to predict the sentiment of tweets.
3. **Evaluate and compare the performance** of various classification algorithms based on key metrics, such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score

The ultimate objective is to create a reliable system capable of automatically identifying and preventing the spread of negative content on Twitter, contributing to a healthier online environment.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Understanding**: Explore and visualize the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and potential data quality issues.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data, which may include removing stop words, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
3. **Model Building**: Train multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to predict sentiment.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of various models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the best approach.
5. **Deployment**: Develop and deploy the model as an API or integrate it with other tools for practical use.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy (for NLP tasks)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/twitter-sentiment-classification.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Preprocess the data and train the model:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. Run tests and evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

## Conclusion

The ultimate goal of this project is to build a robust NLP model that can automatically classify sentiment in tweets, with a focus on identifying and filtering negative or harmful content. By doing so, this project contributes to creating a safer and more positive online environment on Twitter.
